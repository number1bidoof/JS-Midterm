# JS-Midterm Code Practical
Code Review for the Midterm. Includes both Jupyter Notebooks and individual JS & HTML Files for each unit.

Since Jupyter Notebooks support Deno instead of node.js or npm, there are some things that are not allowed that we covered Vanilia JS, so in the solutions I have commented it out in the jupyter notebook.

All code segments in the jupyter notebook have comments if it is not deno compatible, as well as explanations on how the code works and concepts

In one folder I will have the jupyter notebooks, as well as another folder containing Js and HTMl files, one coresponding for each unit.

If you want to learn more about deno here is the [link](https://deno.com/), I found it very helpful for running **JS** without a HTML file. So check it out if you are intrested in devleoping in JS as a framework.

# Good Luck on the Midterm
