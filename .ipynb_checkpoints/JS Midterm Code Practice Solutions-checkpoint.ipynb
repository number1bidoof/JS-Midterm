    "Both the __solutions__ & __practice__ Notebooks are hosted on *Jupyter Notebook* using *Deno*, a JS runtime that allows you to run **JS without a HTML file**, I figured it would be easier to host it when its integrated in *Jupyter Notebook*, then have 3 million *HTML,JS & CSS* files. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about deno here is the [link](https://deno.com/), I found it very helpful for running **JS** without a HTML file. So check it out if you are intrested in devleoping in JS as a framework.\n",
